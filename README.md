# PM2.5 Prediction System using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting PM2.5 (Particulate Matter 2.5) concentration using machine learning techniques. PM2.5 are fine inhalable particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or smaller, which can cause serious health issues. Accurate forecasting of PM2.5 levels is crucial for environmental monitoring and public health management.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Predicts PM2.5 concentration based on historical air quality and weather data

Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations

Multiple ML models implemented (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score

Interactive plots for results and performance

Easy-to-understand and modular code

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn

XGBoost / LightGBM (optional)

Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (for demo/visualization)

Git & GitHub
